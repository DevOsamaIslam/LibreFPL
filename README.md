# LibreFPL

A small Vite + React app for exploring Fantasy Premier League data using local JSON files in src/data (snapshot.json, fixtures.json). No backend or API keys are required; run locally for quick checks and comparisons of players, teams, and simple charts.

Install with npm install, start with npm run dev, build with npm run build, and preview with npm run preview. Keep feature code under src/modules, shared components in src/components, and shared types in src/lib. License: MIT.
